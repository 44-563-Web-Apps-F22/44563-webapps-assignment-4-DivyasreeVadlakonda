                      <h4>POINT</h4>          Oh! a private buffoon is a light-hearted loon,<br>
                      If you listen to popular rumour;<br>
                 From morning to night he's so joyous and bright,<br>
                      And he bubbles with wit and good humour!<br>
                 He's so quaint and so terse,<br>
                           Both in prose and in verse;<br>
                      Yet though people forgive his transgression,<br>
                 There are one or two rules that all family fools<br>
                      Must observe, if they love their profession.<br>
                           There are one or two rules,<br>
                                Half-a-dozen, maybe,<br>
                           That all family fools,<br>
                                Of whatever degree,<br>
                      Must observe if they love their profession.<br>
     
                 If you wish to succeed as a jester, you'll need<br>
                      To consider each person's auricular:<br>
                 What is all right for B would quite scandalize C<br>
                 <p class="direction"></p>
                      <p>(For C is so very particular);</p><br>
                 And D may be dull, and E's very thick skull<br>
                      Is as empty of brains as a ladle;<br>
                 While F is F sharp, and will cry with a carp,<br>
                      That he's known your best joke from his cradle!<br>
                           When your humour they flout,<br>
                                You can't let yourself go;<br>
                           And it does put you out<br>
                                When a person says, "Oh!<br>
                      I have known that old joke from my cradle!"<br>
     
                 If your master is surly, from getting up early<br>
                 <p class="direction"></p>
                      <p>(And tempers are short in the morning),</p><br>
                 An inopportune joke is enough to provoke<br>
                      Him to give you, at once, a month's warning.<br>
                 Then if you refrain, he is at you again,<br>
                      For he likes to get value for money:<br>
                 He'll ask then and there, with an insolent stare,<br>
                      "If you know that you're paid to be funny?"<br>
                           It adds to the tasks<br>
                                Of a merryman's place,<br>
                           When your principal asks,<br>
                                With a scowl on his face,<br>
                      If you know that you're paid to be funny?<br>
     
                 Comes a Bishop, maybe, or a solemn D.D.—<br>
                      Oh, beware of his anger provoking!<br>
                 Better not pull his hair—<br>
                           Don't stick pins in his chair;<br>
                      He won't understand practical joking.<br>
                 If the jests that you crack have an orthodox smack,<br>
                      You may get a bland smile from these sages;<br>
                 But should it, by chance, be imported from France,
                      Half-a-crown is stopped out of your wages!<br>
                           It's a general rule,<br>
                                Tho' your zeal it may quench,<br>
                           If the Family Fool<br>
                                Makes a joke that's too French,<br>
                      Half-a-crown is stopped out of his wages!<br>
