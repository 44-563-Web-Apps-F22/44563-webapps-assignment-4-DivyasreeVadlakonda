  CHORUS              Night has spread her pall once more,
                      And the pris'ner still is free:
                 Open is his dungeon door,
                      Useless now his dungeon key.
                 He has shaken off his yoke—
                      How, no mortal man can tell!
                 Shame on loutish jailor-folk—
                      Shame on sleepy sentinel!

       [Enter JACK POINT, in low spirits, reading from a huge
       volume

  POINT     [reads] "The Merrie Jestes of Hugh Ambrose, No.
            7863.The Poor Wit and the Rich Councillor. A certayne
            poor wit, being an-hungered, did meet a well-fed
            councillor.'Marry, fool,' quothe the councillor,
            'whither away?' 'In truth,' said the poor wag, 'in
            that I have eaten naught these two dayes, I do wither
            away, and that right rapidly!' The Councillor laughed
            hugely, and gave him a sausage." Humph! the councillor
            was easier to please than my new master the
            Lieutenant. I would like to take post under that
            councillor. Ah! 'tis but melancholy mumming when poor
            heart-broken, jilted Jack Point must needs turn to
            Hugh Ambrose for original light humour!

       [Enter WILFRED, also in low spirits.

  WILFRED   [sighing] Ah, Master Point!

  POINT     [changing his manner] Ha! friend jailer! Jailer that
            wast— jailer that never shalt be more! Jailer that
            jailed not, or that jailed, if jail he did, so
            unjailery that 'twas but jerry-jailing, or jailing in
            joke— though no joke to him who, by unjailerlike
            jailing, did so jeopardise his jailership. Come, take
            heart, smile, laugh, wink, twinkle, thou tormentor
            that tormentest none— thou racker that rackest not—
            thou pincher out of place— come, take heart, and be
            merry, as I am!— [aside, dolefully]— as I am!

  WILFRED   Aye, it's well for thee to laugh. Thou hast a good
            post, and hast cause to be merry.

  POINT     [bitterly] Cause? Have we not all cause? Is not the
            world a big butt of humour, into which all who will
            may drive a gimlet? See, I am a salaried wit; and is
            there aught in nature more ridiculous? A poor, dull,
            heart-broken man, who must needs be merry, or he will
            be whipped; who must rejoice, lest he starve; who must
            jest you, jibe you, quip you, crank you, wrack you,
            riddle you, from hour to hour, from day to day, from
            year to year, lest he dwindle, perish, starve,
            pine,and die! Why, when there's naught else to laugh
            at, I laugh at myself till I ache for it!

  WILFRED   Yet I have often thought that a jester's calling would
            suit me to a hair.

  POINT     Thee? Would suit thee, thou death's head and cross-
            bones?

  WILFRED   Aye, I have a pretty wit— a light, airy, joysome wit,
            spiced with anecdotes of prison cells and the torture
            chamber. Oh, a very delicate wit! I have tried it on
            many a prisoner, and there have been some who smiled.
            Now it is not easy to make a prisoner smile. And it
            should not be difficult to be a good jester, seeing
            that thou are one.

  POINT     Difficult? Nothing easier. Nothing easier. Attend, and
            I will prove it to thee!

       No. 14. Oh! a private buffoon is a light-hearted loon
                               (SONG)
                               Point

  POINT          Oh! a private buffoon is a light-hearted loon,
                 If you listen to popular rumour;
            From morning to night he's so joyous and bright,
                 And he bubbles with wit and good humour!
            He's so quaint and so terse,
                      Both in prose and in verse;
                 Yet though people forgive his transgression,
            There are one or two rules that all family fools
                 Must observe, if they love their profession.
                      There are one or two rules,
                           Half-a-dozen, maybe,
                      That all family fools,
                           Of whatever degree,
                 Must observe if they love their profession.

            If you wish to succeed as a jester, you'll need
                 To consider each person's auricular:
            What is all right for B would quite scandalize C
                 (For C is so very particular);
            And D may be dull, and E's very thick skull
                 Is as empty of brains as a ladle;
            While F is F sharp, and will cry with a carp,
                 That he's known your best joke from his cradle!
                      When your humour they flout,
                           You can't let yourself go;
                      And it does put you out
                           When a person says, "Oh!
                 I have known that old joke from my cradle!"

            If your master is surly, from getting up early
                 (And tempers are short in the morning),
            An inopportune joke is enough to provoke
                 Him to give you, at once, a month's warning.
            Then if you refrain, he is at you again,
                 For he likes to get value for money:
            He'll ask then and there, with an insolent stare,
                 "If you know that you're paid to be funny?"
                      It adds to the tasks
                           Of a merryman's place,
                      When your principal asks,
                           With a scowl on his face,
                 If you know that you're paid to be funny?

            Comes a Bishop, maybe, or a solemn D.D.—
                 Oh, beware of his anger provoking!
            Better not pull his hair—
                      Don't stick pins in his chair;
                 He won't understand practical joking.
            If the jests that you crack have an orthodox smack,
                 You may get a bland smile from these sages;
            But should it, by chance, be imported from France,
                 Half-a-crown is stopped out of your wages!
                      It's a general rule,
                           Tho' your zeal it may quench,
                      If the Family Fool
                           Makes a joke that's too French,
                 Half-a-crown is stopped out of his wages!

            Though your head it may rack with a bilious attack,
                 And your senses with toothache you're losing,
            And you're mopy and flat—
                      they don't fine you for that
                 If you're properly quaint and amusing!
            Though your wife ran away with a soldier that day,
                 And took with her your trifle of money;
            Bless your heart, they don't mind—
                      they're exceedingly kind—
                 They don't blame you—as long as you're funny!
                      It's a comfort to feel
                           If your partner should flit,
                      Though you suffer a deal,
                           They don't mind it a bit—
                 They don't blame you—so long as you're funny!

  POINT     And so thou wouldst be a jester eh?

  WILFRED   Aye!

  POINT     Now, listen! My sweetheart, Elsie Maynard, was
            secretly wed to this Fairfax half an hour ere he
            escaped.

  WILFRED   She did well.

  POINT     She did nothing of the kind, so hold thy peace and
            perpend. Now, while he liveth she is dead to me and I
            to her, and so, my jibes and jokes notwithstanding, I
            am the saddest and the sorriest dog in England!

  WILFRED   Thou art a very dull dog indeed.

  POINT     Now, if thou wilt swear that thou didst shoot this
            Fairfax while he was trying to swim across the river—
            it needs but the discharge of an arquebus on a dark
            night— and that he sank and was seen no more, I'll
            make thee the very Archbishop of jesters, and that in
            two days'time! Now, what sayest thou?

  WILFRED   I am to lie?

  POINT     Heartily. But thy lie must be a lie of circumstance,
            which I will support with the testimony of eyes,
            ears,and tongue.

  WILFRED   And thou wilt qualify me as a jester?

  POINT     As a jester among jesters. I will teach thee all my
            original songs, my self-constructed riddles, my own
            ingenious paradoxes; nay, more, I will reveal to thee
            the source whence I get them. Now, what sayest thou?

  WILFRED   Why, if it be but a lie thou wantest of me, I hold it
            cheap enough, and I say yes, it is a bargain!

                 No. 15. Hereupon we're both agreed
                               (DUET)
                         Point and Wilfred

  BOTH           Hereupon we're both agreed,
                      All that we two
                      Do agree to
                 We'll secure by solemn deed,
                      To prevent all
                      Error mental.

  POINT               You on Elsie are to call
                      With a story
                      Grim and gory;

  WILFRED             How this Fairfax died, and all
                      I declare to
                      You're to swear to.

  POINT                    I to swear to!

  WILFRED                  I declare to,

  POINT                    I to swear to!

  WILFRED                  I declare to,

  BOTH                I to swear to,/I declare to,
                      You declare to,/You're to swear to,
                      I to swear to,/I declare to.

  BOTH           Tell a tale of cock and bull,
                 Of convincing detail full
                      Tale tremendous,
                      Heav'n defend us!
                 What a tale of cock and bull!

                 In return for your/my own part
                      You are/I am making, undertaking
                 To instruct me/you in the art
                      (Art amazing, wonder raising)

  POINT               Of a jester, jesting free.
                      Proud position—
                      High ambition!

  WILFRED             And a lively one I'll be,
                      Wag-a-wagging,
                      Never flagging!

  POINT                    Wag-a-wagging,

  WILFRED                  Never flagging,

  POINT                    Wag-a-wagging,

  WILFRED                  Never flagging,

  BOTH                Never flagging,/Wag-a-wagging,

                 What a tale of cock and bull!

  POINT               What a tale of cock,

  WILFRED             What a tale of bull!

  POINT               What a tale of cock,

  WILFRED             What a tale of bull!

  BOTH           What a tale of cock and bull,
                      Cock and bull, cock and bull,
                 Heav'n defend us!
                 What a tale of cock and bull!

       [Exeunt together.

       [Enter FAIRFAX

  FAIRFAX   Two days gone, and no news of poor Fairfax. The dolts!
            They seek him everywhere save within a dozen yards of
            his dungeon. So I am free! Free, but for the cursed
            haste with which I hurried headlong into the bonds of
            matrimony with— Heaven knows whom! As far as I
            remember, she should have been young; but even had not
            her face been concealed by her kerchief, I doubt
            whether, in my then plight, I should have taken much
            note of her. Free? Bah! The Tower bonds were but a
            thread of silk compared with these conjugal fetters
            which I, fool that I was, placed upon mine own hands.
            From the one I broke readily enough— how to break the
            other!
                 No. 16. Free from his fetters grim
                              (BALLAD)

  FAIRFAX             Free from his fetters grim—
                      Free to depart;
                 Free both in life and limb—
                      In all but heart!
                 Bound to an unknown bride
                      For good and ill;
                 Ah, is not one so tied
                      A pris'ner still, a pris'ner still?
                 Ah, is not one so tied
                      A pris'ner still?

                 Free, yet in fetters held
                      Till his last hour,

                      Had set him free,

                      The saddest he, the saddest he!

       [Enter SERGEANT MERYLL

  FAIRFAX   Well, Sergeant Meryll, and how fares thy pretty
            charge,Elsie Maynard?

  MERYLL    Well enough, sir. She is quite strong again, and
            leaves us to-night.

  FAIRFAX   Thanks to Dame Carruthers' kind nursing, eh?

  MERYLL    Aye, deuce take the old witch! Ah, 'twas but a sorry
            trick you played me, sir, to bring the fainting girl
            to me. It gave the old lady an excuse for taking up
            her quarters in my house, and for the last two years
            I've shunned her like the plague. Another day of it
            and she would have married me! [Enter DAME CARRUTHERS
            and KATE] Good Lord, here she is again! I'll e'en go.
            [Going]

  DAME      Nay, Sergeant Meryll, don't go. I have something of
            grave import to say to thee.

  MERYLL    [aside] It's coming.

  FAIRFAX   [laughing] I'faith, I think I', not wanted here.
            [Going]

  DAME      Nay, Master Leonard, I've naught to say to thy father
            that his son may not hear.

  FAIRFAX   [aside] True. I'm one of the family; I had forgotten!

  DAME      'Tis about this Elsie Maynard. A pretty girl, Master
            Leonard.

  FAIRFAX   Aye, fair as a peach blossom— what then?

  DAME      She hath a liking for thee, or I mistake not.

  FAIRFAX   With all my heart. She's as dainty a little amid as
            you'll find in a midsummer day's march.

  DAME      Then be warned in time, and give not thy heart to her.
            Oh, I know what it is to give my heart to one who will
            have none of it!

  MERYLL    [aside] Aye, she knows all about that.
            [Aloud] And why is my boy to take heed of her? She's
            a good girl, Dame Carruthers.

  DAME      Good enough, for aught I know. But she's no girl.
            She's a married woman.

  MERYLL    A married woman! Tush, old lady— she's promised to
            Jack Point, the Lieutenant's new jester.

  DAME      Tush in thy teeth, old man! As my niece Kate sat by
            her bedside to-day, this Elsie slept, and as she slept
            she moaned and groaned, and turned this way and that
            way— and, "How shall I marry one I have never seen?"
            quoth she— then, "An hundred crowns!" quoth she—
            then,"Is it certain he will die in an hour?" quoth
            she— then, "I love him not, and yet I am his wife,"
            quoth she! Is it not so, Kate?

  KATE      Aye, aunt, 'tis even so.

  FAIRFAX   Art thou sure of all this?

  KATE      Aye, sir, for I wrote it all down on my tablets.

  DAME      Now, mark my words: it was of this Fairfax she spake,
            and he is her husband, or I'll swallow my kirtle!

  MERYLL    [aside] Is it true, sir?

  FAIRFAX   [aside to MERYLL] True? Why, the girl was raving!
            [Aloud] Why should she marry a man who had but an hour
            to live?

  DAME      Marry? There be those who would marry but for a
            minute, rather than die old maids.

  MERYLL    [aside] Aye, I know one of them!

  FAIRFAX   So my mysterious bride is no other than this winsome
            Elsie! By my hand, 'tis no such ill plunge in
            Fortune's lucky bag! I might have fared worse with my
            eyes open! But she comes. Now to test her principles.
            'Tis not every husband who has a chance of wooing his
            own wife!

       [Enter ELSIE

  FAIRFAX   Mistress Elsie!

  ELSIE     Master Leonard!

  FAIRFAX   So thou leavest us to-night?

  ELSIE     Yes. Master Leonard. I have been kindly tended, and I
            almost fear I am loth to go.

  FAIRFAX   And this Fairfax. Wast thou glad when he escaped?

  ELSIE     Why, truly, Master Leonard, it is a sad thing that a
            young and gallant gentleman should die in the very
            fullness of his life.

  FAIRFAX   Then when thou didst faint in my arms, it was for joy
            at his safety?

  ELSIE     It may be so. I was highly wrought, Master Leonard,
            and I am but a girl, and so, when I an highly wrought,
            I faint.

  FAIRFAX   Now, dost thou know, I am consumed with a parlous
            jealousy?

  ELSIE     Thou? And of whom?

  FAIRFAX   Why, of this Fairfax, surely!

  ELSIE     Of Colonel Fairfax?

  FAIRFAX   Aye. Shall I be frank with thee? Elsie— I love thee,
            ardently, passionately! [ELSIE alarmed and surprised]
            Elsie, I have loved thee these two days— which is a
            long time— and I would fain join my life to thine!

  ELSIE     Master Leonard! Thou art jesting!

  FAIRFAX   Jesting? May I shrivel into raisins if I jest! I love
            thee with a love that is a fever— with a love that is
            a frenzy— with a love that eateth up my heart! What
            sayest thou? Thou wilt not let my heart be eaten up?

  ELSIE     [aside] Oh, mercy! What am I to say?

  FAIRFAX   Dost thou love me, or hast thou been insensible these
            two days?

  ELSIE     I love all brave men.

  FAIRFAX   Nay, there is love in excess. I thank heaven there are
            many brave men in England; but if thou lovest them
            all, I withdraw my thanks.

  ELSIE     I love the bravest best. But, sir, I may not listen—
            I am not free— I— I am a wife!

  FAIRFAX   Thou a wife? Whose? His name? His hours are
            numbered—nay, his grave is dug and his epitaph set up!
            Come, his name?

  ELSIE     Oh, sir! keep my secret— it is the only barrier that
            Fate could set up between us. My husband is none other
            than Colonel Fairfax!

  FAIRFAX   The greatest villain unhung! The most ill-favoured,
            ill-mannered, ill-natured, ill-omened, ill-tempered
            dog in Christendom!

  ELSIE     It is very like. He is naught to me— for I never saw
            him. I was blindfolded, and he was to have died within
            the hour; and he did not die— and I am wedded to him,
            and my heart is broken!

  FAIRFAX   He was to have died, and he did not die? The
            scoundrel! The perjured, traitorous villain! Thou
            shouldst have insisted on his dying first, to make
            sure. 'Tis the only way with these Fairfaxes.

  ELSIE     I now wish I had!

  FAIRFAX   [aside] Bloodthirsty little maiden!
            [Aloud] A fig for this Fairfax! Be mine— he will never
            know— he dares not show himself; and if he dare, what
            art thou to him? Fly with me, Elsie— we will be
            married tomorrow, and thou shalt be the happiest wife
            in England!

  ELSIE     Master Leonard! I am amazed! Is it thus that brave
            soldiers speak to poor girls? Oh! for shame, for
            shame! I am wed— not the less because I love not my
            husband. I am a wife, sir, and I have a duty, and— oh,
            sir!— thy words terrify me— they are not honest— they
            are wicked words, and unworthy thy great and brave
            heart! Oh,shame upon thee! shame upon thee!

  FAIRFAX   Nay, Elsie, I did but jest. I spake but to try thee—

  FAIRFAX                  Why, an arquebus—
                 Fired from the wharf, unless I much mistake.

  MERYLL         Strange— and at such an hour! What can it mean!

       [Enter CHORUS excitedly

  CHORUS              Now what can that have been—
                 A shot so late at night,
                      Enough to cause a fright!
                 What can the portent mean?

                 Are foemen in the land?
                      Is London to be wrecked?
                      What are we to expect?
                 What danger is at hand?

  LIEUT.         Who fired that shot? At once the truth declare?

  WILFRED        My lord, 'twas I— to rashly judge forebear!

  POINT          My lord, 'twas he— to rashly judge forebear!

  WILFRED             Like a ghost his vigil keeping—

  POINT                    Or a spectre all-appalling—

  WILFRED             I beheld a figure creeping—

  POINT                    I should rather call it crawling—

  WILFRED             He was creeping—

  POINT                         He was crawling—

  WILFRED             He was creeping, creeping—

  POINT                         Crawling!

  WILFRED             He was creeping—

  POINT                         He was crawling—

  WILFRED             He was creeping, creeping—

  POINT                         Crawling!

  WILFRED             Not a moment's hesitation—
                      I myself upon him flung,
                 With a hurried exclamation
                      To his draperies I hung;
                 Then we closed with one another
                 In a rough-and-tumble smother;
                 Col'nel Fairfax and no other
                      Was the man to whom I clung!

  ALL            Col'nel Fairfax and no other,
                      Was the man to whom he clung!

  WILFRED             After mighty tug and tussle—

  POINT                    It resembled more a struggle—

  WILFRED             He, by dint of stronger muscle—

  POINT                    Or by some infernal juggle—

  WILFRED             From my clutches quickly sliding—

  POINT                    I should rather call it slipping—

  WILFRED             With a view, no doubt, of hiding—

  POINT                    Or escaping to the shipping—

  WILFRED             With a gasp, and with a quiver—

  POINT                    I'd describe it as a shiver—

  WILFRED             Down he dived into the river,
                      And, alas, I cannot swim.

  ALL            It's enough to make one shiver,
                 With a gasp, and with a quiver,
                 Down he dived into the river;
                      It was very brave of him!

  WILFRED             Ingenuity is catching;
                      With the view my King of pleasing,
                 Arquebus from sentry snatching—

  POINT                    I should rather call it seizing—

  WILFRED             With an ounce or two of lead
                 I dispatched him through the head!

  ALL            With an ounce or two of lead
                 He dispatched him through the head!

  WILFRED             I discharged it without winking,
                 Little time I lost in thinking,
                 Like a stone I saw him sinking—

  POINT                    I should say a lump of lead.

  ALL            He discharged it without winking,
                 Little time he lost in thinking.

  WILFRED             Like a stone I saw him sinking—

  WILFRED             Like a stone, my boy, I said—

  POINT                    Like a heavy lump of lead.

  WILFRED             Like a stone, my boy, I said—

  POINT                    Like a heavy lump of lead.

  WILFRED             Anyhow, the man is dead,
                 Whether stone or lump of lead!

       [Exeunt all but ELSIE, POINT, FAIRFAX, and PHOEBE.

  POINT     [to ELSIE, who is weeping] Nay, sweetheart, be
            comforted. This Fairfax was but a pestilent fellow,
            and, as he had to die, he might as well die thus as
            any other way. 'Twas a good death.

  ELSIE     Still, he was my husband, and had he not been, he was
            nevertheless a living man, and now he is dead; and so,
            by your leave, my tears may flow unchidden, Master
            Point.

  FAIRFAX   And thou didst see all this?

  POINT     Aye, with both eyes at once— this and that. The
            testimony of one eye is naught— he may lie. But when
            it is corroborated by the other, it is good evidence
            that none may gainsay. Here are both present in court,
            ready to swear to him!

  PHOEBE    But art thou sure it was Colonel Fairfax? Saw you his
            face?

  POINT     Aye, and a plaguey ill-favoured face too. A very hang-
            dog face— a felon face— a face to fright the headsman
            himself, and make him strike awry. Oh, a plaguey, bad
            face, take my word for it. [PHOEBE and FAIRFAX laugh]
            How they laugh! "Tis ever thus with simple folk— an
            accepted wit has but to say "Pass the mustard," and
            they roar their ribs out!

  FAIRFAX   [aside] If ever I come to life again, thou shalt pay
            for this, Master Point!

            me: I am young and well-favoured. I have a pretty wit.

            you, riddle you—

  FAIRFAX   Tush, man, thou knowest not how to woo. 'Tis not to be
            done with time-worn jests and thread-bare sophistries;
            with quips, conundrums, rhymes, and paradoxes. 'Tis an
            art in itself, and must be studied gravely and
            conscientiously.

                 How to flatter, cajole, and persuade.

                 He should 'prentice himself at fourteen,
                 And practise from morning to e'en;

  ALL                 It is purely a matter of skill,
                      Which all may attain if they will.
                           But every Jack
                           He must study the knack
                      If he wants to make sure of his Jill!
                      If he wants to make sure of his Jill!

  ELSIE               If he's made the best use of his time,
                 His twig he'll so carefully lime
                      That every bird
                      Will come down at his word,
                 Whatever its plumage and clime.

                 He must learn that the thrill of a touch
                 May mean little, or nothing, or much;
                      It's an instrument rare,
                      To be handled with care,
                 And ought to be treated as such,
                      Ought to be treated as such.

  ALL                 It is purely a matter of skill,
                      Which all may attain if they will:
                           But every Jack,
                           He must study the knack

                      If he wants to make sure of his Jill!

  PHOEBE              Then a glance may be timid or free;
                 It will vary in mighty degree,
                      From an impudent stare
                      To a look of despair
                 That no maid without pity can see!
                 And a glance of despair is no guide—
                 It may have its ridiculous side;
                      It may draw you a tear
                      Or a box on the ear;
                 You can never be sure till you've tried!
                      Never be sure till you've tried!

  ALL            It is purely a matter of skill,

                 If he wants to make sure of his Jill!
                      Yes, every Jack,
                      Must study the knack
                 If he wants to make sure of his Jill!

  FAIRFAX   [aside to POINT] Now, listen to me— 'tis done thus—
            [aloud] Mistress Elsie, there is one here who, as thou
            knowest, loves thee right well!

  POINT     [aside] That he does— right well!

  FAIRFAX   He is but a man of poor estate, but he hath a loving,
            honest heart. He will be a true and trusty husband to
            thee, and if thou wilt be his wife, thou shalt lie
            curled up in his heart, like a little squirrel in its
            nest!

  POINT     [aside] 'Tis a pretty figure. A maggot in a nut lies
            closer, but a squirrel will do.

  FAIRFAX   He knoweth that thou wast a wife— an unloved and
            unloving wife, and his poor heart was near to
            breaking. But now that thine unloving husband is dead,
            and thou art free, he would fain pray that thou
            wouldst hearken unto him, and give him hope that thou
            wouldst one day be his!

  PHOEBE    [alarmed] He presses her hands— and whispers in her
            ear! Ods bodikins, what does it mean?

  FAIRFAX   Now, sweetheart, tell me— wilt thou be this poor
            goodfellow's wife?

  ELSIE     If the good, brave man— is he a brave man?

  FAIRFAX   So men say.

  POINT     [aside] That's not true, but let it pass.

  ELSIE     If the brave man will be content with a poor,
            penniless, untaught maid—

  POINT     [aside] Widow— but let that pass.

  ELSIE     I will be his true and loving wife, and that with my
            heart of hearts!

  FAIRFAX   My own dear love! [Embracing her]

  PHOEBE    [in great agitation] Why, what's all this? Brother—
            brother— it is not seemly!

  POINT     [also alarmed, aside] Oh, I can't let that pass!
            [Aloud] Hold, enough, Master Leonard! An advocate
            should have his fee, but methinks thou art over-paying
            thyself!

  FAIRFAX   Nay, that is for Elsie to say. I promised thee I would
            show thee how to woo, and herein lies the proof of the
            virtue of my teaching. Go thou, and apply it
            elsewhere! [PHOEBE bursts into tears]

                 No. 20. When a wooer goes a-wooing

                 Elsie, Phoebe, Fairfax, and Point

  ELSIE                    When a wooer Goes a-wooing,
                      Naught is truer Than his joy.

  FAIRFAX                  Maiden hushing All his suing—
                      Boldly blushing, bravely coy!
                           Bravely coy! Boldly blushing—

  ELSIE                    Boldly blushing, bravely coy!

  ALL                 Oh, the happy days of doing!
                      Oh, the sighing and the suing!
                      When a wooer goes a-wooing,
                           Oh the sweets that never cloy!

  PHOEBE [weeping]              When a brother leaves his sister
                           For another, sister weeps,
                           Tears that trickle,
                                Tears that blister—
                           'Tis but mickle Sister reaps!

  ALL                 Oh, the doing and undoing,
                      Oh, the sighing and the suing,
                      When a brother goes a-wooing,
                           And a sobbing sister weeps!

  POINT                    When a jester Is outwitted,
                      Feelings fester, Heart is lead!
                      Food for fishes Only fitted,
                      Jester wishes He was dead!
                      Food for fishes Only fitted,
                      Jester wishes He was dead!

  ALL                 Oh, the doing and undoing,
                      Oh, the sighing and the suing,
                      When a jester goes a-wooing,
                           And he wishes he was dead!

                      Oh, the doing and undoing,
                      Oh, the sighing and the suing,
                      When a jester goes a-wooing,
                           And he wishes he was dead,
                           And he wishes he was dead!

       [Exeunt all but PHOEBE, who remains weeping.

  PHOEBE    And I helped that man to escape, and I've kept his
            secret, and pretended that I was his dearly loving
            sister, and done everything I could think of to make
            folk believe I was his loving sister, and this is his
            gratitude! Before I pretend to be sister to anybody
            again, I'll turn nun, and be sister to everybody— one
            as much as another!

       [Enter WILFRED

  WILFRED   In tears, eh? What a plague art thou grizzling for
            now?

  PHOEBE    Why am I grizzling? Thou hast often wept for jealousy—
            well, 'tis for jealousy I weep now. Aye, yellow,
            bilious, jaundiced jealousy. So make the most of that,
            Master Wilfred.

  WILFRED   But I have never given thee cause for jealousy. The
            Lieutenant's cook-maid and I are but the merest
            gossips!

  PHOEBE    Jealous of thee! Bah! I'm jealous of no craven cock-
            on-a-hill, who crows about what he'd do an he dared!
            I am jealous of another and a better man than thou—
            set that down, Master Wilfred. And he is to marry
            Elsie Maynard, the pale little fool— set that down
            Master Wilfred— and my heart is wellnigh broken!
            There, thou hast it all! Make the most of it!

  WILFRED   The man thou lovest is to marry Elsie Maynard? Why,
            that is no other than thy brother, Leonard Meryll!

  PHOEBE    [aside] Oh, mercy! what have I said?

  WILFRED   Why, what matter of brother is this, thou lying little
            jade? Speak! Who is this man whom thou hast called
            brother, and fondled, and coddled, and kissed!— with
            my connivance, too! Oh Lord! with my connivance! Ha!
            should it be this Fairfax! [PHOEBE starts] It is! It
            is this accursed Fairfax! It's Fairfax! Fairfax, who—

  PHOEBE    Whom thou hast just shot through the head, and who
            lies at the bottom of the river!

  WILFRED   A— I— I may have been mistaken. We are but fallible
            mortals, the best of us. But I'll make sure— I'll make
            sure. [Going]

  PHOEBE    Stay— one word. I think it cannot be Fairfax— mind, I
            say I think— because thou hast just slain Fairfax. But
            whether he be Fairfax or no Fairfax, he is to marry
            Elsie— and— and— as thou hast shot him through the
            head, and he is dead, be content with that, and I will
            be thy wife!

  WILFRED   Is that sure?

  PHOEBE    Aye, sure enough, for there's no help for it! Thou art
            a very brute— but even brutes must marry, I suppose.

  WILFRED   My beloved. [Embraces her]

  PHOEBE    [aside] Ugh!

       [Enter LEONARD MERYLL, hastily

  LEONARD   Phoebe, rejoice, for I bring glad tidings. Colonel
            Fairfax's reprieve was signed two days since, but it
            was foully and maliciously kept back by Secretary
            Poltwhistle, who designed that it should arrive after
            the Colonel's death. It hath just come to hand, and it
            is now in the Lieutenant's possession!

  PHOEBE    Then the Colonel is free? Oh, kiss me, kiss me, my
            dear! Kiss me, again, and again!

  WILFRED   [dancing with fury] Ods bobs, death o' my life! Art
            thou mad? Am I mad? Are we all mad?

  PHOEBE    Oh, my dear— my dear, I'm well nigh crazed with joy!
            [Kissing LEONARD]

  WILFRED   Come away from him, thou hussy— thou jade— thou
            kissing, clinging cockatrice! And as for thee, sir,
            devil take thee, I'll rip thee like a herring for
            this! I'll skin thee for it! I'll cleave thee to the
            chine! I'll— oh! Phoebe! Phoebe! Who is this man?

  PHOEBE    Peace, fool. He is my brother!

  WILFRED   Another brother! Are there any more of them? Produce
            them all at once, and let me know the worst!

  PHOEBE    This is the real Leonard, dolt; the other was but his
            substitute. The real Leonard, I say— my father's own
            son.

  WILFRED   How do I know this? Has he "brother" writ large on his
            brow? I mistrust thy brothers! Thou art but a false
            jade!

       [Exit LEONARD.

  PHOEBE    Now, Wilfred, be just. Truly I did deceive thee
            before— but it was to save a precious life— and to
            save it, not for me, but for another. They are to be
            wed this very day. Is not this enough for thee? Come—
            I am thy Phoebe— thy very own— and we will be wed in
            a year— or two— or three, at the most. Is not that
            enough for thee?

       [Enter SERGEANT MERYLL, excitedly, followed by DAME
       CARRUTHERS, who listens, unobserved.

  MERYLL    Phoebe, hast thou heard the brave news?

  PHOEBE    [still in WILFRED's arms] Aye, father.

  MERYLL    I'm nigh mad with joy! [Seeing WILFRED] Why, what's
            all this?

  PHOEBE    Oh, father, he discovered our secret thorough my
            folly, and the price of his silence is—

  WILFRED   Phoebe's heart.

  PHOEBE    Oh, dear, no— Phoebe's hand.

  WILFRED   It's the same thing!

  PHOEBE    Is it?

       [Exeunt WILFRED and PHOEBE.

  MERYLL    [looking after them] "Tis pity, but the Colonel had to
            be saved at any cost, and as thy folly revealed our
            secret, thy folly must e'en suffer for it!

            [DAME CARRUTHERS comes down] Dame Carruthers!

  DAME      So this is a plot to shield this arch-fiend, and I
            have detected it. A word from me, and three heads
            besides his would roll from their shoulders!

  MERYLL    Nay, Colonel Fairfax is reprieved.
            [Aside] Yet, if my complicity in his escape were
            known! Plague on the old meddler! There's nothing for
            it—
            [aloud]— Hush, pretty one! Such bloodthirsty words ill
            become those cherry lips!
            [Aside] Ugh!

  DAME      [bashfully] Sergeant Meryll!

  MERYLL    Why, look ye, chuck— for many a month I've— I've
            thought to myself— "There's snug love saving up in
            that middle-aged bosom for some one, and why not for
            thee— that's me— so take heart and tell her— that's
            thee— that thou— that's me— lovest her— thee— and—
            and— well,I'm a miserable old man, and I've done it—
            and that's me!" But not a word about Fairfax! The
            price of thy silence is—

  DAME      Meryll's heart?

  MERYLL    No, Meryll's hand.

  DAME      It's the same thing!

  MERYLL    Is it?

  POINT                    It is sung to the moon
                      By a love-lorn loon,
                 Who fled from the mocking throng, O!
            It's a song of a merryman, moping mum,
            Whose soul was sad, and whose glance was glum,
            Who sipped no sup, and who craved no crumb,
                 As he sighed for the love of a ladye.

            It's the song of a merrymaid, peerly proud,
                           [optional— nestling near,]
            Who loved her lord, and who laughed aloud
                      [optional— but dropped a tear]
            At the moan of the merryman, moping mum,
            Whose soul was sad, and whose glance was glum,
            Who sipped no sup, and who craved no crumb,
                 As he sighed for the love of a ladye!

  ALL                 Heighdy! heighdy!
                      Misery me—lack-a-day-dee!
